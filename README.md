## üìö About Data
The data used in this project was taken from  http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ . Berkeley Earth is a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive climate data for research and public use. They focus on analyzing historical temperature records and producing datasets that contribute to understanding global climate change. We can find three sets of dataset: 
## Global Land Temperature Dataset: 
This dataset includes historical monthly average temperatures from land-based stations worldwide. It covers data starting from the 18th century to the present. The data is adjusted for known biases and gaps.
## Regional Land Temperature Dataset: 
Offers temperature data segmented by region (continent, country, and state/province levels) with monthly averages.
## Temperature Anomaly Datasets: 
Provides anomalies relative to a baseline period (e.g., 1951-1980). It‚Äôs used to see how current temperatures deviate from long-term averages.


## üí° Highlights 

- Most regions on Earth are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures compared to historical baselines.
The Arctic and northern high-latitude regions are warming faster than the global average, exhibiting 2 to 4 times the global temperature increase.
- There is a noticeable increase in extreme temperature events, such as heatwaves and record-high temperatures.
The frequency and intensity of extremely hot days have increased over recent decades, indicating a shift in temperature distribution.
- The 1970s marked the beginning of a rapid rise in global temperatures, largely due to increased greenhouse gas emissions.
- Each decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the previous one, with accelerated warming observed in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Data Wrangling

Conducted simple data wrangling and data cleaning:
- Replaced rows with missing values
- We added the region and the continent corresponding to each country

## üìä Visualization

Produced Dashboard to visualize the following :

- Plot a simple line graph of Global Cumulative CO2 Emission over the years

- Create a Bar Graph of Top 20 Countries with highest CO2 Emission in 2020

- Time series of cumulative CO2 emission of top 5 countries

- Comparison Graph of Top 5 countries for 2020

- Top 10 cumulative CO2 emission per person in 2020

- Create Plotly Choropleth Map with Years animated on X-axis and CO2 Emission on Y-axis to show world CO2 emission through years on world map

o   Show the same for Africa, Europe, Russia, and USA
